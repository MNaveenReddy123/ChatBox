# ChatBox - Chat Application

ChatBox is a real-time chat application built using **Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.io**. It enables instant messaging by leveraging **WebSockets**, allowing seamless, bidirectional communication between users. Socket.io ensures efficient message broadcasting, real-time event handling, and persistent connections, making the chat experience smooth and interactive. The application features a responsive UI where sent messages align to the right and received messages to the left, mimicking modern chat interfaces. This project serves as a foundation for real-time communication and can be extended with additional features like user authentication and chat history storage.
